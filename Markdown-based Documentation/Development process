## 2. Development Process

### Step 1 — Understanding the Assignment  
The goal was to create a simple calculator using Python with clear input/output formatting and no advanced features.

### Step 2 — Writing the Base Code  
- Started by taking two numeric inputs from the user.  
- Displayed a simple menu to choose the operation.  
- Used `if-elif` statements to perform the chosen operation.

### Step 3 — Adding Basic Validation  
- Ensured only valid menu choices (1–4) are accepted.  
- Added a check for division by zero.

### Step 4 — Cleaning and Finalizing  
- Removed unnecessary complexity.  
- Ensured the code is formatted simply and clearly.  
- Prepared README, `.gitignore`, and a proper folder structure.

### Step 5 — Documentation  
- Added Markdown-based documentation in a separate `docs/` folder.  
- Explained project overview, development steps, and future improvements.
