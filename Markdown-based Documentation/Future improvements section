## 3. Future Improvements

These are optional features that could be added later:

- Add support for more operations (square root, power, modulus).
- Create a loop to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
- Convert the program into a GUI version using Tkinter.
- Add error logging or debugging messages.
- Create separate functions for each operation.
- Add unit tests for reliability.
- Allow the calculator to handle expressions (e.g., “3 + 5 * 2”).
