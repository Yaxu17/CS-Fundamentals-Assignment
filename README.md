# Mini Calculator — Assignment Submission
I have made Calculator Program by Python

## Overview
This is a simple calculator program for assignment submission.  
It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using straightforward input → choice → output flow.

## How to run
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python /Calculator_program.py
```
(Or run the file from your IDE. The script expects console input.)

## Teacher notes (what I implemented)
- Uses plain `input()` for numbers and operation choice.
- Performs basic validation for operation choice and dividing by zero.
- No functions or advanced concepts.

## Submission checklist
-  `Calculator_program.py` present and runs without syntax errors.
-  `README.md` included (this file).
-  `.gitignore` included (optional, but recommended).
-  At least 5 meaningful commits (if submitting via GitHub) — commit messages example:
  - `init: add calculator program`
  - `docs: add README`
  - `chore: add .gitignore`
  - `docs: Markdown-based Documentation`
  - `adding file in Markdown Documentation`

## Features

- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Provides a simple menu to choose an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
- Performs the selected arithmetic operation.
- Displays the result clearly in a readable format.
- Handles invalid menu choices by showing an error message.
- Checks for division by zero and prevents the error.
- Uses basic Python concepts suitable for beginner-level assignments.
- Straightforward, clean, and easy-to-understand code structure.
